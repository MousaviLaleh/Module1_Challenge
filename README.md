# Kickstarter Challenge: Louise’s play fundraising goal
## Overview of Project
Louise, a playwright, wants to start a crowdfunding campaign fund her play, Fever, with estimating a budget of over $10,000. With using Excel to organize and analyze crowdfunding data, we will determine whether there are specific factors that make a project’s campaign successful. The purpose is to help Louise to gain a greater understanding of campaigns from start to finish, and we'll be able to set her campaign to mirror other successful ones in the same category.

### Purpose
Now her play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
After retrieving the data from previous campaigns, and performing it into a readable format in excel, we can help Louise set up her incentives by first determining how much money people have pledged to campaigns historically.<br/>

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To help the Louise plan her campaign timeline, we need to take a closer look at how campaign length might be tied to its outcome. We should consider time, or more specifically, whether the length of a campaign makes a difference in determining its success. For example, is a shorter or longer campaign more effective? Is there a certain time of year when campaigns tend to be more successful?<br/>

Line charts are helpful when trying to determine trends. The chart shows the months that launched the most successful campaigns was May, June and July. Although Feb, Apr, and Aug have the same range of oucomes, but in compare with others, they can provide quiet well outcome. However, May to October, all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. Overal May, Jun and July is the best time to run her campaigns.<br/>

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To continue to help Louise plan her campaign, we need to be more specific with our searches. In this way we'll be able to pinpoint the ones most similar to Louise's vision. Now, we need to collect the outcome and goal data for the “plays” and visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount.<br/>

Failed campaigns have much higher fundraising amounts than successful Kickstarter campaigns.<br/>
